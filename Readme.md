# CSS BOX MODEL

- The CSS Box Model is the way elements are laid out on a web page.
- It consists of:
  Content: the main area of the element where text and images are placed.
  Padding: the space between the content and the border.
  Border: the line that surrounds the padding and content.
  Margin: the space outside the border.
- The width and height of an element is determined by the content, padding, borders, and margins.
- By default, the box-sizing property in CSS is set to "content-box," meaning the width and height properties only refer to the content area.
- Setting the box-sizing property to "border-box" will include the padding and borders in the width and height calculations.
