# Positioning

- By default every element is positioned as static
- Relative positioning is used to position the element relative to it's original position
- Absolute positioning is used to position the element relative to it's parent element
- Fixed positioning is used to position the element relative to the browser window. It keeps the element fixed at one place even if we scroll the page 
- Sticky positioning is used to position the element relative to the browser window. It keeps the element fixed at one place even if we scroll the page. It is similar to fixed positioning but it is relative to the nearest scrollable ancestor instead of the browser window
